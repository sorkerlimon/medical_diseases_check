- **Database Operations:**
  - Insert new data.
  - Retrieve and display data in a table format.
  - Update existing records.
  - Delete records.
- **Table View:** Scrollable table to display datasets or retrieved data.

#### Tab 2: Health Data Analysis
- **Data Filtering Section:**
  - Dropdowns for selecting variables (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure).
  - Sliders to adjust filtering parameters.
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Dropdown menus to select health metrics.
  - Compute correlation coefficient and display scatter plots and heatmaps.
- **Time-series Visualization:**
  - Plot time-series data.
  - Toggle between raw and filtered data.

#### Tab 3: Spectrum Analysis

- **FFT Spectrum Analysis:**
  - Compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
  - Display power spectrum or frequency components.
  - Sliders for selecting time window or signal segment.
- **Visualization Controls:** Adjust axis limits and zoom.

#### Tab 4: Medical Image Processing
- **Image Loading:**
  - Upload medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRI, CT scans).
  - Display the uploaded image.
- **Image Processing Operations:**
  - Grayscale conversion.
  - Smoothing/Blurring (Gaussian, median).
  - Edge detection (Canny).
  - Thresholding with adjustable slider.
- **Comparison Display:** Original and processed images shown side by side.

#### Tab 5: Data Visualization
- **Charts and Graphs:**
  - Time-series plots.
